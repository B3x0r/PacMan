# PacMan Excercise with setInterval
 
#### Description:
 
This was a week 4 assignment. It's just a PacMan type character going across the screen and back using setInterval.
 
#### Installation:

I thought you could just copy the files into a folder on your device. Then, you drag the .html file and it into the url line. I cannot get that to work.
 
#### Usage:
 
For now, it is just a fun to watch PacMan in his natural habitat without ***Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde***.
 
#### Support: 
 
I don't foresee anyone actually using this for a while.
 
#### Roadmap: 
 
I would love to create fruit for PacMan to eat. Or maybe add a bow to make **Ms.** PacMan.
