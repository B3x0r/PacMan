# PacMan Excercise with setInterval
 
#### Description:
 
This project uses HTML and Javascrip and was a week 4 assignment. It's just a PacMan type character going across the screen and back using setInterval.

#### Installation:

You can just copy the files into a folder on your device. Then, you drag the .html file and it into the url line. Then, you can watch Pacman chop across the screen, hit the edge, come back, and repeat...until you are bored.
 
#### Usage:
 
For now, it is just a fun to watch PacMan in his natural habitat without ***Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde***.
 
#### Support: 
 
I don't foresee anyone actually using this for a while.
 
#### Roadmap: 
 
I would love to create fruit for PacMan to eat. Or maybe add a bow to make **Ms.** PacMan.
